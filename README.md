# CSS Positioning
CSS positioning is a concept that we use to layout elements in our HTML page the way we need them to be placed. 
## Types of Positioning
1. **Static**: This is the HTML default layout. It happens automatically as elements are placed on top of the other. 
2. **Relative**: Occurs when an element is positioned in relation to its original position(static). It is relative to its supposed position. 
3. **Absolute**: This type happens to a descendat child in relation to its nearest positioned ancestor or the top left corner of the browser. 
4. **Fixed**: The position of an element does not change even if you scroll as it remains to where you have placed it. It is relative to the top left corner of the browser. 


*When it comes to positioning, the key properties are: **top**, **bottom**, **left**, and **right**.*
